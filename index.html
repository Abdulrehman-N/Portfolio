        <h2>Dungeon Shot</h2>
        <p>The purpose of this game is to control a bullet to hit as many targets as possible while not touching the top and bottom borders. Targets will spawn randomly in between the borders<br> at a specific distance away from the previous target. Missing the target will result in the game to come to a closure and open the Retry menu. Every 10 targets, the speed of the bullet<br> will be incremented. The key objective is to get the highest score possible by hitting the targets and possibly gathering coins alongside. Coins are worth 3 points whereas the targets<br> are worth 1. However, the targets are required in order to continue the game.<br><br>Controls:<br><br>
“Space” Key - Holding this key will make the bullet start to travel vertically up.
<br><br>
“Esc” Key - Once in the retry screen, pressing Esc will allow the player to go back to the menu screen.

        <h2>Super Breakout</h2>
        <p>This is a classic game of Breakout. The goal is to clear all the pieces seen on the screen through the use of the ball. You get to control the pieces at the bottom which can go right <br>and left. Using this, you must prevent the ball from touching the ground and bounce it off your piece to clear the top area. If it hits the ground, you will lose a life; You have 3 lives.<br> Once they all run out, the game will end. Clicking space after death will allow for a re-run. Clicking "c" after death will allow you to switch between singleplayer and multiplayer.</p>

        <h2>Connect 4</h2>
        
        <p>There are two different implementations of connect 4 that I have made. One is created on Python and the other is created using html,css and javascript meaning<br> it is playable on this very site. Both of these versions are Player vs AI. To play, click on a column to place your piece and the AI will do the same. To win,<br> you must be the first to get four of your pieces aligned in a row. This can be done vertically, horizontally or diaogonally. Clicking the reset button will clear the board. <br>For the Python version, if you win, you will be able to add your name to the hall of fame which can be seen once its re-ran.</p>
